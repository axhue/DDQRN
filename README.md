## Results

Pending!


## Next up!
 * Attention Mechanisms
 * Hindsight Experience Replay
 * A2C methods
 * Metaheuristics

## Interesting Notes
 * I previously thought that pseudo huber loss was identical to huber loss, this [article](https://jaromiru.com/2017/05/27/on-using-huber-loss-in-deep-q-learning/) was very useful in helping me make the model work better
