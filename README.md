# minecraftRL
An RL agent work in progress to be used to learn from multi-objective tasks

At this stage the agent is trying to use a DQN on the standard environments (Cliffwalking) however results are not promising, therefore
the algorithm is being upgraded to the variants of DQN (DDQN,DQRN,Dueling-DQN).
